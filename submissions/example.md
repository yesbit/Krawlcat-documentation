# Project Name: DAI stable coin 

# Authors and Github username: MakerDAO (@makerdao)

# Description of the Project 

A stable coin for the cryptocurreny market that maintains its price at $1USD

# Problem specification related to Krawlcat Network 

Cryptocurrencies have high volatility and fluctuations, in order to facilitate commerce it is essential to have a cryptocurrency with stability like USD. DAI maintains the price of $1 USD through the CDP platform that collateralizes Ether. 

As blockchains are closed protocols, there is no awareness of what the price of Ether is at any given point. In order to make the CDP platfrom viable, reliable knowledge about Ether's price is crucial.

# Solution in relation to Krawlcat Network 

In order to retrieve cryptocurrency prices (like Ether) an intermediary between blockchains and the current internet infrastructure (web 2.0) is essential. This is what Krawlcat oracles can be used for.
